Rails app get started steps

- rails new myrailsblog
- cd myrailsblog
- add anything particular to your needs / project to .gitignore
- git init
- git commit initial commit
- add line to config/application.rb to allow all attributes to be accessed 
- use console to create test users (or posts, or whatever)
- if you change the routes file, you need to restart the server
- define helpers in ApplicationHelper to make them available to all Controllers & Views (e.g. current_user)
